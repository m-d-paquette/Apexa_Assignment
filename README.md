## install

### Prerequisite 

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- .NET Core SDK (version 8.0 or higher)
- Node.js (version 14.0 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Running the Application

1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

    start.bat
    ```

This script will build and run the .NET Core API and then install dependencies and start the ReactJS application.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure ports 3000 and 5105 are available on your machine, as the ReactJS application typically runs on port 3000 and the .NET Core API on port 5105.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation of each technology (Node.js, .NET Core) for troubleshooting steps.
